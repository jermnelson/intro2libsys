Evergreen
---------
[Evergreen](http://open-ils.org/) is a full-featured open-source 
intergrated library system that is used by over 800 libraries. 
Evergreen was created in 2006 by the
Georgia Public Library System as an ILS for a consortium of about 250 
public libraries. Evergreen uses `PostgreSQL`_ as the database backend 
with `PERL`_ and `Apache`_ webserver as the front-end to the ILS.

Notable installations of Evergreen, include the first installation of
the Georgia Public Library Service's `PINES`_, the `King County Library
System`_ in Washington State, and the Massachusetts Library Network Cooperative 
with their `C/W MARS`_ and `NOBLE`_ catalogs. For a complete listing of 
libraries using Evergreen, see the following website:

Koha
----
`Koha`_ was one of the first open-source ILS that stared development in 1999 
with the `Horowhenua Library Trust`_ of New Zealand. In 2010 
due to concerns about trademark and managment of the `koha.org <koha.org>`_
domain being taken over by a Koha commerical support company called LibLime, 
the offical version of the ILS moved to a separate domain. LibLime does
provide customer support for their varient of Koha marketed under 
`LibLime Koha`_ product name. The LibLime supported version of Koha has 
about 700 libraries using their product. Koha, like Evergreen, uses PERL and
Apache but uses `MySQL`_ instead of PostgreSQL for the backend database. Koha
also uses the `Zebra`_ for searching within in the ILS.

As you expect, there is a large number of internatinal libraries that use
Koha, including the first developers of Koha with their 
`Horowhenue Library Catalog`_. Other motable Koha installations in the 
United States include the `North Kansas Library System`_ and the 
`Norwich Public Library`_ .

Aristotle
---------
One of the newest open-source discovery systems is called `Aristotle`_
that is a forked version of an abandoned open-source project called `Kochief`_.
Aristotle and Kochief are based on `Django`_, a Python-based open-source
web development platform as a search inteferface to a `Solr`_ index of MARC
records. Aristotle also provides a `Fedora Commons`_ inteface using the 
Emory University's `Eulfedora`_ Python module.

As Aristotle is the newest open-source discovery interface, there is currently
only one active site, Colorado College's `TIGER`_ catalog.

Blacklight
----------
`Blacklight`_ is a `Ruby-on-Rails`_ application that is an open-source 
discovery interface to a Solr index. Blacklight has an active developer
community and also provides an interface to the Fedora Commons digital
repository server through another open-source project based on Blacklight,
called `Hydra`_. 

`John Hopkins University`_, `Stanford University`_, 
`University of Virginia`_, `University of Wisconsin-Madison`_,
the `Rock & Roll Hall of Fame`_, and `Northwestern University`_ either use Blacklight
for their production discovery interface or are in beta testing. A more 
complete list of active Blacklight installations is available at 
`https://github.com/projectblacklight/blacklight/wiki/Examples <https://github.com/projectblacklight/blacklight/wiki/Examples>`_.


VuFind
------
`VuFind`_ is an open-source PHP-based discovery interface that uses 
Apache, MySQL, and Solr. 

`Auburn University`_, `Brown University`_, `Colorado State University`_, 
`Marmot Library Network`_, and `Villanova University`_ among others all use 
VuFind as their primary discovery user interface. A more complete list
of institutions and organizations that use VuFind are available at 
`http://vufind.org/wiki/installation_status <http://vufind.org/wiki/installation_status>`_.
