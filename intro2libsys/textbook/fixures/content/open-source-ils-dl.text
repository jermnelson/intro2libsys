Evergreen
---------
[Evergreen](http://open-ils.org/) is a full-featured open-source 
intergrated library system that is used by over 800 libraries. 
Evergreen was created in 2006 by the
Georgia Public Library System as an ILS for a consortium of about 250 
public libraries. Evergreen uses [PostgreSQL](http://www.postgresql.org/) 
as the database backend with [PERL](http://www.perl.org/) and 
[Apache](http://httpd.apache.org/) webserver as the front-end to the ILS.

Notable installations of Evergreen, include the first installation of
the Georgia Public Library Service's [PINES](http://gapines.org/opac/en-US/skin/default/xml/index.xml), 
the [King County Library System](http://catalog.kcls.org/eg/opac/home) in 
Washington State, and the Massachusetts Library Network Cooperative 
with their [C/W MARS](http://www.cwmars.org/) and [NOBLE](http://www.noblenet.org/)
catalogs. For a complete listing of 
libraries using Evergreen, see the following website:

Koha
----
[Koha](http://www.koha.org/) was one of the first open-source ILS 
that stared development in 1999 with the 
[Horowhenua Library Trust](http://www.library.org.nz/) of New Zealand. In 2010 
due to concerns about trademark and managment of the [koha.org](http://www.koha.org)
domain being taken over by a Koha commerical support company called LibLime, 
the offical version of the ILS moved to a separate domain. LibLime does
provide customer support for their varient of Koha marketed under 
LibLime Koha product name. The LibLime supported version of Koha has 
about 700 libraries using their product. Koha, like Evergreen, uses PERL and
Apache but uses [MySQL](http://www.mysql.com/)
instead of PostgreSQL for the backend database. Koha
also uses the [Zebra](http://www.indexdata.com/zebra) for searching within in the ILS.

As you expect, there is a large number of internatinal libraries that use
Koha, including the first developers of Koha with their 
[Horowhenue Library Catalog](http://www.library.org.nz/cgi-bin/koha/opac-search.pl). 
Other notable Koha installations in the United States include the 
[North Kansas Library System](http://catalog.nexpresslibrary.org/)
and the [Norwich Public Library](http://www.norwichlibrary.org/pages/catalog.htm).

Aristotle
---------
One of the newest open-source discovery systems is called
[Aristotle](https://github.com/jermnelson/Discover-Aristotle)
that is a forked version of an abandoned open-source project called 
Kochief. Aristotle and Kochief are based on [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/), 
a Python-based open-source web development platform as a search inteferface to a 
[Solr](http://lucene.apache.org/solr/) index of MARC records. Aristotle also 
provides a [Fedora Commons](http://fedora-commons.org/) inteface using the 
Emory University's [Eulfedora]( ) Python module.

As Aristotle is the newest open-source discovery interface, there is currently
only one active site, Colorado College's [TIGER](http://discovery.coloradocollege.edu) 
catalog.

Blacklight
----------
[Blacklight](http://projectblacklight.org/) is a 
[Ruby-on-Rails]( http://rubyonrails.org/) application that is an open-source 
discovery interface to a Solr index. Blacklight has an active developer
community and also provides an interface to the Fedora Commons digital
repository server through another open-source project based on Blacklight,
called [Hydra](http://hydraproject.org/). 

[John Hopkins University](http://catalyst.library.jhu.edu/),
[Stanford University](http://searchworks.stanford.edu/), 
[University of Virginia](http://search.lib.virginia.edu/), [University of Wisconsin-Madison](http://forward.library.wisconsin.edu/),
the [Rock & Roll Hall of Fame](http://catalog.rockhall.com/), and 
[Northwestern University](http://findingaids.library.northwestern.edu/) either use Blacklight
for their production discovery interface or are in beta testing. A more 
complete list of active Blacklight installations is available at 
[https://github.com/projectblacklight/blacklight/wiki/Examples](https://github.com/projectblacklight/blacklight/wiki/Examples).


VuFind
------
[VuFind](http://vufind.org/) is an open-source PHP-based discovery interface that uses 
Apache, MySQL, and Solr. 

[Auburn University](http://catalog.lib.auburn.edu/vufind/), [Brown University](http://library.brown.edu/), 
[Colorado State University](http://discovery.library.colostate.edu/), 
[Marmot Library Network](http://opac.marmot.org/), and [Villanova University](http://library.villanova.edu/Find) 
among others all use VuFind as their primary discovery user interface. A more complete list
of institutions and organizations that use VuFind are available at 
[http://vufind.org/wiki/installation_status](http://vufind.org/wiki/installation_status).
