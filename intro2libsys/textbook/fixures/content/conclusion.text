In the preceding chapters, we started with a survey of library technology through history,
explored various legacy and emerging bibliographic data technologies, with an introduction
to XML standards like VRA, MODS, Dublin Core, and TEI. We then broaden the scope of library
technologies, starting from the main ILS and library services platforms, on through general
information technology infrastructure that is shared by most types of organizations. Finally,
we shifted to the future, looking at different organizational models from outside the library
field on how we can better organize library systems and also considering what libraries may
look like in five years from now.
