The critical core of most library systems revolve around searching, access,
and manipulation of descriptions of physical and electronic resources. 
[MARC21](http://www.loc.gov/marc/) is the current data carrier for library 
bibliographic records and reflects over
40 years of library systems and cataloging practice. Originally designed as
a communication format for information regarding the collections of different
libraries, MARC evolved to become the unit record of bibliographic information 
for that library systems. These library systems either use the native MARC format or
convert the records to a relational database or full-search index. 

While MARC still dominates library systems, other communities with different requirements
have developed alternative data descriptions, or meta-data, of their resources to 
better meet their own requirements.  In the past 15 years with in the exponential 
growth in web pages and other born electronic media like images, audio, and 
video. Often, many of these meta-data standards describe similar concepts, like
creator, title, copyright but structure those concepts in different ways, either 
through different hierarchies, or with different levels of specificity. 

For example, [ONIX](http://www.bisg.org/what-we-do-21-15-onix-for-books.php)
(Online Information Exchange) is used by the publishing 
industry for business-to-business exchange within their industry. 
[TEI](http://www.tei-c.org/) (Text Encoding Initiative) is a complex 
meta-data standard used to markup digital documents in a very specific 
semantic fashion. Most users of TEI
only use a subset of the TEI standard. Probability the most widely used
meta-data standard in use is called [Dublin Core](http://dublincore.org/).
