          <p>
		    Pat Wagner's Organizational Map is composed of three levels; Task, Managerial, and Leadership.

			<a href="https://github.com/jermnelson/aristotle-library-apps">Aristotle Library App</a> open source

          <h4>The Lean Start-up</h4>
          <p>Eric Ries, an entrepreneur and author, writes about <em>The Lean Start-up</em> philosophy that start-up 
		     companies can use to successful build and launch a new products and services. His four principles of 
			 a lean start-ups provide a "start-up" framework for library systems and operations that can transform 
			 the services and technology we offer our patrons and improve the library's relevancy in a community or
			 an organization.

		  <h4>FRBR, RDA, &amp; Redis MARCR Datastore</h4>
          <p>In our current library ILS, OPACS, and even next-generation of library services platforms being developed by
	     library vendors, offer minimal support for 
             <a href="{% url techbytes.views.glossary %}#FRBR">FRBR</a> and 
             <a href="{% url techbytes.views.glossary %}#RDA">RDA</a>. RDA, an effort
             lead by the <a href="{% url techbytes.views.glossary %}#ALA">ALA</a> and others, is based on 
             FRBR and is intended to be the replacement of <a href="{% url techbytes.views.glossary %}#AACR2">AACR2</a>. 
             There is much concern
             about the added cost, lack of supporting technologies, and complexity for implementing RDA from the 
             <a href="{% url techbytes.views.glossary %}#MARC21">MARC21</a>-based 
	     technologies being used and developed in libraries.</p>
	  <p>
            <a href="{% url techbytes.views.glossary %}#MARCR">MARCR</a> is the name given to a new proposal by the 
            Library of Congress's Bibliographic Framework Initiative that
            borrows many concepts from both RDA and MARC21 to support a more of a 
            <a href="{% url techbytes.views.glossary %}#LinkedData">Linked-Data</a> 
            approach to bibliographic records.
