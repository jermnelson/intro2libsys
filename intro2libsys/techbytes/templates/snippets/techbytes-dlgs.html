    Library Systems and cutting-edge technology used by Silicon Valley start-ups are 
    not often associated with each other; however, the Tutt Library at Colorado College 
    is developing and uses an HTML5 mobile app environment that connects to a 
    bibliographic datastore server implemented in Redis.
  </p>
  <p>
    Redis is a popular NoSQL key-value technology used by such companies as StackOverflow, 
    Craigslist, and other websites with extremely high and demanding data needs. The 
    flexibility of Redis allows the library to quickly respond to staff and users requests 
    for different functionality and access points that would be very difficult or impossible 
    with traditional library systems. 
  </p>
  <p>
    Redis also allows for easy experimentation and so it is the first production-level 
    implementation of the Library of Congress Bibliographic Framework's new data model, MARCR.  
    Finally, a preview of a consortium-level bibliographic Redis datastore done in 
    collaboration with the Colorado Alliance of Research Libraries, will presented that allows 
    for new and different kinds mobile-based access and discovery apps along with resource-sharing 
    services for library users and staff.
