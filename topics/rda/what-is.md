# What is Resource Description and Access (RDA)

RDA is a newer framework for bibliographic cataloging that includes guidelines 
and instructions for describing artifacts and relationships of those artifacts 
with entities like a person, organizations, and concepts. RDA is based on the
FRBR and FRAD (Functional Requirements for Authority Data) specifications as well 
as incorporating various elements from AACR2.

RDA is meant to support end user resource discovery in library systems in 
finding a resource, identifying a specific resource among similar resources, 
selecting a resource, and finally obtaining the resource. Likewise, for 
entities associated with resources, RDA should assist end users in finding 
information on the entity or resources associated with the entity, identifying
the entity from among similar entities, clarifying the relationship between the 
entity and other entities, and understanding why an entity has a certain name, 
title, or form.
