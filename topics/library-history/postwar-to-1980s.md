Title: Postwar to the 1980s

World War II's massive destruction of buildings in Europe and Asia, which not 
surprisingly included a larger number of libraries in those regions including 
an estimated 1/2 of all books in China [#]_ . Recovering ... 

In the immediate aftermath until well into the 1960s, numerous countries 
went on a library building spree, either rebuilding damaged or destroyed
libraries and construction of new libraries, both public and academic 
libraries to support new colleges and universities being founded especially
in Asia. 

Vannevar Bush
-------------
Vannevar Bush was an American engineer who work included analog computers
and during World War II coordinate most scientific research for the American
war effort including a critical oversight of the Manhattan project that 
produced the first atomic weapons. In 1945, Bush published a very influential
essay, `As We May Think`_ that described a new type of information
organization with what we would think of as hyperlinks in a large corpus of
text. This essay was very influential for early computer scientists, including
Douglas Engelbart the inventor of the mouse and hypertext [#]_ , as they 
developed the first digital computers in the later half of the 20th century.

Even at this early stage in the development of the modern personal computer, 
the challenges to the library and its supporting technologies becomes evident
as Bush and Englebart, among others, was already looking at a different model
of information organization that was different from the conceptual models and
technologies used in the libraries at the time. Clearly they were influenced by 
how knowledge was organized at their time but they also offer still relevant 
insights in how humans interact with information as not as passive actors but
an active and engaged intellence seeking, responding, and creating information.

Rise of MARC, Electronic Catalogs, and Consortiums
--------------------------------------------------
We will be going into more detail in a later chapter about the technology behind
the still dominate format used to structure bibliographic records and for resource
sharing called Machine-Readable Cataloging or MARC. MARC was the result of the efforts
by Henriette Avram of the Library of Congress, among others, to create an electronic
cataloging format for record interchange. The use and adoption of MARC allowed libraries
to allow automated resource discovery and for the development of the modern inter-library
loan services offered by most academic and public libraries. 

It was in the late 1970s and early 1980s that electronic catalog started to be developed and
offered by larger institutions. These first generation catalogs usually tried to mimic
the card catalog already understood by library patrons and were primarily text-based and 
accessed through dump terminals connected to a central mainframe computer. 

Library consortiums also had their beginnings at this time with the found of OCLC, in the 
1960s and regional consortiums like the precursor to the Colorado Alliance of Research 
Libraries and Marmot in Colorado in the 1970s and 1980s. We will also be examining library 
consortiums in a later chapter as well.
