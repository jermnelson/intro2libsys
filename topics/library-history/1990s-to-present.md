Title: 1990s to the Present

The start of the 1990s was a move away from the main-frame to a client-server
model for library systems, including the arrival of "Online Public Access Catalog" 
or (OPAC). Almost immediately, these often primitive OPACS were much more 
popular among library users than the physical card catalog or first-generation
"text-based" catalogs of the 1970s and 1980s. The designs of these early OPACs
reflected two different access models, one deeply ground in assumptions and
behavior of using the physical card catalog with author, title, and subject
access points and the other was in the commercial data services of the time, like
`DIALOG`_. `DIALOG`_ was an early online information services that included
access to a number of full-text journal databases, the service still exists as
a product from ProQuest.

In his 1995 report, Dr. Charles Hildreth documented a list of serious
failings of OPACs in the 1990s. [#]_ The OPAC's of the time offered a combination of 
two different access models for user interfaces, the first was a transplant of the
physical card catalog to an online environment, the second access model followed the
information retrieval models of the earlier commercial databases like `DIALOG`_.  These
combination interfaces offered more access points but failed to fully offer the type 
of services that Hildreth referred to as E cubed; **enhanced** functionality and 
usability, **expanded** indexing of data records and improved collection coverage,
and **extended** through linking to other networks and additional library collections
and other library and information systems. As the report states:

  The areas that present the most difficulties to searchers of today's online 
  catalogs are the following: understanding and using Boolean operators; 
  implementing good, appropriate search strategies for the task at hand; 
  expressing accurate and complete queries in a form acceptable by the system; 
  and matching search terms to the system's indexing language. That these 
  conceptual and "entry" requirements for good searching represent formidable 
  challenges even for highly-trained database search specialists indicates that 
  fundamentally new and different approaches may need to be applied in the 
  design of end-user search interfaces and retrieval methods. 

In her article [#]_ about ten or so years later, Karen Markey at the University of Michigan 
again evaluated the state of the online library catalogs and she lists a few reasons why
library OPACs used by most libraries today failed to transform to something suggested by
Hildreth including a shift in library focus from technical services to public services,
increasing costs of cataloging, the failure of Information Retrieval research and the lack
of library vendors to respond to the shifts in search behavior with the advent of Google and
other commercial search services. Markey suggests that the design of online catalogs in the
future should embrace subject catalog and expanded qualification metadata to enhance a 
catalog that uses post-boolean probabilistic searching.

In the five years since Markey and close to twenty years since Hildreth's report, the 
library technology used in systems has shifted to what are called "Discovery layers" that
use Post Boolean probabilistic searching using such popular open-source search projects as
`Solr`_, to try to bring Library search interfaces to library catalogs and often to the 
other resources purchased by the library or the library's digital repository.
