Title: Introduction

In early 2012 a group of academics, frustrated and upset by continued
price increase of Elsevier journals, along with Elsevier's lobbying
support the Research Works Act that would have rolled back open access
and open data requirements, started a boycott that rapidly made 
headlines in the non-academic press. In Academic publishing, unlike
other publishing venues, writing, editing, and managing the scholarly 
workflow is mostly done free-of-charge to the publisher by academics.
Individuals pledged not publish, referee, or do any editorial work for
Elseviear.
   
A group of more radical academics suggested that libraries, in  
particular academic libraries, take on more of a scholarly publishing
role which differs from the library's traditional role of collecting
and disseminating materials.
