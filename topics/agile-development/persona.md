Personas and User Stories
-------------------------
Most agile methodologies for projects start with the creation of short and simple
descriptions of what the user is trying to accomplish with the software being 
developed. Ideally, these user stories come from the user themselves, either directly
or through observing or interviewing the user. The user stories are then collected 
and prioritized with time estimates for completion.
