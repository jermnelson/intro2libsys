Title: Test Driven Development

Test Driven Development (TDD)
-----------------------------
As the user story is implemented in software, Agile methodology encourages the creation
of automated software tests to insure that the requirements from the user story are 
being met. There are a number of different ways to test software, with the most radical
being **Test-Driven Development (TDD)**, a model where the developers write the tests first and
then write software code for the system that passes the tests. A common criticism of TDD is
that developers may write code to just pass the tests and not actual meet the requirements. 
The two most common ways to do software testing and both can be used for TDD are 
**Unit Testing** and **Behavior-driven development (BDD)**

## Unit Tests
Unit testing at its most basic, is about creating an automated test that can be run 
against a specific piece of code to see if the code performs as expected given an
initial set of variables and state of the system. 

## Integration Tests

## Behavioral Tests
Behavior-driven development, or BDD, is a different method for testing software. With BDD,
a user scenario is crafted in way that the test framework and extract test conditions that
are then tested against the system. While Unit Testing focuses on testing specific code, a
BDD testing is more usefully for testing how well various sections in the code-base interact
to meet a user need or requirement.
