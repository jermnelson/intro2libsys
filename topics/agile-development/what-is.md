Title: What is Agile Development?

Technology is complex and can fail spectacularly or present subtle errors with
bizarre side effects. By being transparent along with an adaptable approach to problems, library
systems can be unified with the larger purpose and goals of the library. The Agile Software Development 
emphasis on simplicity, should be a good and quick yardstick for evaluating different
options to solve technology problems that will occur.

What is Agile Development?
--------------------------
Agile Software Development is a set of software developmental practices and methodology
based on short, iterative cycles, where the requirements are defined for small areas of 
functionality and the code is developed and tested against those requirements. 

Application in the Library
--------------------------
While  Agile Software development focus on the development of working software,
the process must start with researching the user's needs before development or 
assessment begins. Common methods for researching the library users include recruiting
from staff or student social networks[1][1], analyze the search terms in the library web
server logs, COUNTER Reports for Research Databases, reference session summaries, and 
library gate counts.
