Comr's statement, \" Obviously, we still need back-end catalogs (or the equivalent) to feed our holdings into our discovery systems, but the user interface is no longer necessary.\" in the first section reflects some of thinking on this issue."

They basically use a binary yes/no for a couple of their UX critera for Discovery tools that really gloss over what I consider critical evaluation, the \"actionable metrics\" for discovery tools, namely their UX."
