Agile organizational principles are useful in improving library systems. The 
`Manifesto for Agile Software Development`_  and is as follows:

  **Individuals and interactions** over processes and tools

  **Working software** over comprehensive documentation

  **Customer collaboration** over contract negotiation

  **Responding to change** over following a plan

Technology is complex and can fail spectacularly or present subtle errors with
bizarre side effects. By being transparent along with adaptable approaches to problems, library
systems unifies with the large purpose and goals of the library. The Agile emphasis on simplicity,
should be a good and quick yardstick for evaluating different options to solve 
technology problems that will occur.
