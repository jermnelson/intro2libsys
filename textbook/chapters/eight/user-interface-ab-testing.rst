User Interface and A/B Testing
==============================
User Interface design, especially applied to web sites and client-based software, is going through 
massive change as people shift from personal computer applications and web sites running on 
browsers, to mobile tablets and smartphones. The addition of swiping and other user interface 
conventions that offer direct touch interfaces. Developing an aesthetic sense for visually 
compelling and effective user interface to often complex or complicated workflows is difficult to 
accomplish but a useful skill to develop. Even if a design is beautiful and fulfills the requirements
of the users, testing these designs is a vital element with various techniques that are used 
to do this, some even before any software or implementation is work is done on a project.

Designing Electronic User Interfaces

To meet the needs patrons, 

World Wide Web

* Legacy Web

* HTML5

Mobile Platforms
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
User Interfaces for Mobile Platforms has exploded in the last five years after Apple 
released their iPhone followed by the iPad. Mobile platforms offer a number of 
user interface and implementation challenges including widely different capabilities 
including different screen sizes, processing power, and network access. 

* iOS
  Apple, with their release of the iPhone in 2007 and the iPad in 2010, are the market
  leaders in mobile platform user interface design and technology. While Google's Android
  now has a larger market share [#]_, iOS is the trend-setter for mobile platforms. Apple's
  `iOS Human Interface Guidelines`_, is an online reference for developing apps on the iOS
  platform. In this resource, Apple lists six human interface principles for app developers;
  *Aesthetic Integrity*, *Consistency*, *Direct Manipulation*, *Feedback*, *Metaphors*, and
  *User Control*. 
  

* Android
  Google released their mobile platform, Android, based on a heavily modified 
  embedded Linux distribution, in 2008 and after some growing pains, is now the
  most popular Mobile platform running on a wide variety of Smartphones and tablets.
  
  Google suggests mobile app developers follow three design principles; *Enchant Me*,
  *Simplify My Life*, and *Make Me Amazing* [#]_. While these design principles sound
  nice and are a worthy goal, Google further breaks each design principle down into specific
  recommendations. For example, in *Enchant Me*, Google suggests that a good app should surprise
  the user by offering unexpected animations or sounds that enhance the main task, that the app
  should allow user customization, and that the app remember the user's preferences. Under
  *Simplify My Life*, text in the app should be brief, use pictures over words to convey
  information, how options that the user needs in context, provide navigation clues on where the
  user is in the app, don't lose valuable data, and user interface elements work consistently. 
  Finally, in *Developers Design Principles* general tips include enabling shortcuts or tricks 
  everywhere in the app, encouraging and positive language for error messages (even if the 
  error is a definite fault of the user), combine as many steps as possible for complex task 
  flows through the app, and run priority jobs as fast as possible.

* Web Responsive Design


A/B Testing
-----------
A/B Testing is a commonly used technique for evaluating user interface elements in software. 
Usually two variants of a section may be tested with users accessing a website 
randomly getting one or other variant  title. A test might be seeing for a section by seeing 
if the language used in a section title increases action conversions by the user. The features being
considered should be distinct enough that making the addition or modification would make a difference. 
Minor color changes, small variations in wording, or insignificant functionality changes may not be 
different enough to distinguish which of the versions, A or B, is more effective. [#]_
