1. Create three unit tests of the critical functionality in your class project.

2. From the perspective of your end user, create a BDD feature that when tested
   against your class project, succeeds and doesn't create any errors.
   
3. Activate and add the necessary javascript code to enable Google Analytics for
   your course project. If your class project is not web-based, or must run in a
   restricted environment, create and implement usage tracking functionality.
  
4. Create a scatter graph of your usage data from step 3.

5. Create a report that breaks out the different types of operating systems, devices,
   and geographical distribution of your class project or, if that data is not available,
   provide a short written justifation of why that data collection is unavailable or 
   unnecessary.
