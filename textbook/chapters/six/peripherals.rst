Peripherals
===========
Much of the hardware in use in a typically library is to support either
the direct use by the patron, or by library staff for management purposes. 

Even the smallest library usually have at least a printer and a couple of
library-specific computer peripherals like a bar-code reader. Typically support
for library hardware is provided by the library systems (in a small library, 
staff may have multiple responsibilities including hardware support) or by
a central information technology group if the library is part of a larger
organization like a college, university, or local government entity. 


Printers, Scanners, & Copiers
-----------------------------
Modern enterprise copiers from HP, Xerox, and others can function as a laser printer,
scanner, and copier and have eliminated the need to have separate peripherals for
each of these functions. Trade-offs with these newer machines include the scanning
area for objects being more limited than a dedicated flat-bed scanner and that these machines
typically do not offer color printing that is available through an affordable color
laser printer.  

Another ongoing trend for larger organizations is outsource the management of 
their printers, scanners, and copiers to an external party; either directly through a 
service division of the copier or through another consulting company. Some estimates
of cost savings for organizations may realize from contracting with a "Managed Print
Services" (the name for such out-sourcing) can range from 10% up to 30% than if the
organization manages the coping/printing/scanning infrastructure themselves. 

Libraries may have also have specialized book-scanners that allow patrons to self-scan
a monograph without needing to damaging the book. 

Circulation Gates & RFID
------------------------
Most public and academic libraries employ in one form or another, technology to 
alert staff if material is removed from the library without the proper check-out
procedures being followed. The most common technology are magnetic-based where a 
magnet is embedded into the physical media and if the media's magnet is not 
desensitized, then a circulation gate will raise an alarm if the item passes through
it. 

Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) is a not as widely used in libraries but offers
more services to the library than the strictly security one of magnetic-based systems.
In RFID systems, an items location by determined in real-time, allowing for improved
tracking and management of material and also allows libraries to more easily implement
patron self-checkout in the library. The principal draw-back of RFID is that it can be
extremely expensive to migrated to RFID and it is hard to justify the costs compared to 
the existing magnetic-based systems.  

Label Printers & Circulation Barcode Readers
--------------------------------------------
For libraries that have a technical services department, specialized label printers
are needed in order for the staff to print the spine label for books and other physical
media. Even if the library participates in a managed print service, label printers, 
because of their specialized use and role in the library, are often excluded from the 
MPS contract. Other library-specialized hardware include barcode readers used by 
circulation staff for library checkout and checkin of material as well as for periodic
inventory of the library's physical inventory.
