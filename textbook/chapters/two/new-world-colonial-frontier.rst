New World, Colonial, & Frontier Libraries
=========================================
The beginnings of the libraries in the newly discovered Americas, can be
broken down by geographic longitude, that of North and South America. 

South America
-------------
The development of colonial libraries in South America started with the
Spanish colonial exploriation, explotation, and religious conversions
of the Catholic Church. 

North America
-------------
In contrast to the library development in South America, libraries in 
North America started with government libraries for British colonies in 
the 1600 and 1700s. Other important early collections were associated with
some of the first institutions of higher learning that were founded in the 
United States including the first Harvard library in 16xx, Yale library in
17xx, and the University of Virgina in 17xx.

Benjamin Franklin, Early Lending Libraries, and the Revolution
--------------------------------------------------------------
While Benjamin Franklin's is rightly honored for his role in the founding
of the United States and for his multiple accomplishments as a writer,
printer, and inventor, Franklin was also responsible for the first public
lending library in the United States. This early collection of books came 
about when Franklin and a few of contrempories in the 1740s pooled their
resources and established lending rules so that members of the collective 
could more easily share books between themselves. [#]_


Frontier Libraries
------------------
As the United States expanded it borders and more people came to the Americas 
to live and work while displacing the native populations in doing so, collections
of books was somewhat initially constricted by the shear bulk of transporting
a large of number of books. However, most of the early settlers in the 
American West had at least a couple of treasured books most often a copy of
the Bible, hymn books, and early instructional primers for elementary 
education. [NEED SOURCE]
