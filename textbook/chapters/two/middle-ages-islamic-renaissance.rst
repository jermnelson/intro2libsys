Middle Ages, Islamic & Renaissance
==================================

Middle Ages
-----------
While it would be a misnomer to say that the dark ages in Europe included
libraries, in fact after about 300 A.D. organized collections of books
largely disappeared except for isolated collections of early, primarily,
religious material in Christian monasteries. 

The structure and catalogs of these monastic libraries varied but they 
often were more sophisticated than just a simple inventory of a library.
The basic level of classification used in monasteries was by the physical
location of the material with liturgical and other books used in church
services were located near the monastery's chapel. Books that were not used
in the chapel were stored elsewhere and classified as such. As these
collections grew, medieval catalogs would often include a short description
of the shelf or other descriptive information about the book itself to aid
in finding the book in the library. Early cataloging practiced included
assigning book by subject, with the subject being one of the seven liberal arts. 
Theology was usually the first and the most represented in a monastery's collection. 

As the collections of Universities grew in the late Middle Ages, other 
organizational methods were sought to better capture the increase in secular
material in the collections through the use of alphabetical order by subject 
and different subject schemes. [#]_


Early Islamic Libraries
-----------------------
Literacy was valued and helped in part the spread and normalization of
the Arabic language and script following the founding of Islam in the 
5th century. [#]_  Without the value Islamic scholars and peoples had 
for the importance of the written word, many of the works from ancient 
Greece and Rome would have been lost. Islamic libraries were often larger, with greater accessibility for the literate inhabitants of the area they served, than
comparable monastic libraries of the same period. In the larger urban areas,
Public Libraries were opened from the donated and acquired collections of books
by various scholars and caliphs of these Islamic regions with the first
Public library established in Damascus by the caliph Sufyan.
  
The Mosque was often the first Library in a community as this quote 
expressions, the organizational scheme of the library followed certain 
patterns:

   As Islamic libraries collected more and more documents and manuscripts, 
   rooms and shelves were designed and constructed to house the burgeoning
   collections. The scheme for shelving books varied from library to library,
   with the exception of the location of the Qur'an, which was always placed
   on the highest shelf, a practice that is still used today...All
   manuscripts and books were classified and catalogued. One of the earliest
   known library catalogues, a bibliography really, is Al-Fihrist, written
   by al-Nadim (987 A.D.) using the dominant method of cataloging of his time.
   It ranges from the Qur'anic studies and exegeses to literature, philosophy,
   and the sciences. [#]_

Renaissance & the Enlightenment
-------------------------------
With the critical trade routes fueling the economies of early Italian cities
of Venice, Florence, included exposure to the ancient Greek and Roman 
literature that had been preserved in the great Islamic libraries. As wealthy
merchants built up their collections of manuscripts and early codices, the
size of theses collections varied; however, the number of items in a fair-sized
collection would number between 800 to 900. The number of items is not directly
compared to what we would call a work because it was the practice of these
book collectors to bind several works together into a single volume. The practice 
of creating a catalog or inventory for personal libraries increased between
the eleventh and fifteenth centuries as the practice of exchanging these 
catalogs between book collectors became more popular. [#]_ 

While works written in Latin continued to make up the largest share of material
in most Renaissance libraries; collections in different parts of Europe 
started to reflect the local language, be it in French, German, Spanish, 
or English. 

While some collectors organized their collections according to language, 
a subject based classification and organizational system following the rules
established by Pope Nicholas V (1447-1455). These rules followed the general
structure of medieval ecclesiastical collections with the majority of a collection
devoted to religious material including theology and philosophy focusing on 
Aristotle and his commentators. Mathematics was next the subject area 
highlighting works by Euclid, Boethius, and Ptolemy. The last subject category 
was humane literature or what we would call rhetoric, history, grammar, poetry, 
and moral philosophy. A specific example of subject headings from the library 
of dukes of Urbino in Italy include: Scriptures, Church Fathers, Medicine, Law,
Cosmography, History, Poets, Grammarians, and Orators with the more prominent 
and privileged material belonging to religious topics and treaties. [#]_
