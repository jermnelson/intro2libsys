Middle Ages, Islamic & Renaissance
==================================

Middle Ages
-----------
While it would be a misnomer to say that the dark ages in Europe included
libraries, in fact after about 300 A.D. organized collections of books
largely disappeared except for isolated collections of early, primarily,
religious material in Christian monasteries. 

The structure of these monastic libraries revolved around [#]_

Islamic
-------
Literacy was valued and helped in part the spread and normalization of
the Arabic language and script following the growth out of Mecca following
the founding of Islam. [#]_
  
The Mosque as Library:

   As Islamic libraries collected more and more documents and manuscripts, 
   rooms and shelves were designed and constructed to house the burgeoning
   collections. The scheme for shelving books varied from library to library,
   with the exception of the location of the Qur'an, which was always placed
   on the highest shelf, a practice that is still used today...All
   manuscripts and books were classified and catalogued. One of the earliest
   known library catalogues, a bibliography really, is Al-Fihrist, written
   by al-Nadim (987 A.D.) using the dominant method of cataloging of his time.
   It ranges from the Qur'anic studies and exegeses to literature, philosophy,
   and the sciences. [#]_

Renaissance & the Enlightenment
-------------------------------
With the critical trade routes fueling the economies of early Italian cities
of Venice, Florence, included exposure to the ancient Greek and Roman 
literature that had been preserved in the great Islamic libraries. As wealthy
merchants built up their collections of manuscripts and early codices, the
size of theses collections varied; however, the number of items in a fair-sized
collection would number between 800 to 900. The number of items is not directly
compared to what we would call a work because it was the practice of these
book collectors to bind several works together into a single volume. The practice 
of creating a catalog or inventory for personal libraries increased between
the eleventh and fifteenth centuries as the practice of exchanging these 
cataloges between book collectors became more popular. [#]_ 

While works written in Latin continued to make up the largest share of material
in most Renaissance libraries; collections in different parts of Europe 
startied to reflect the local language, be it in French, German, Spanish, 
or English. 

While some collectors organized their collections according to language, 
a subject based classification and organizational system following the rules
established by Pope Nicholas V (1447-1455). These rules followed the general
structure of medieval ecclesistical collections with the majority of a collection
devoted to religious material including theology and philosophy focusein on 
Aristotle and his commentators. Mathematics was next the subject area 
highlighting works by Euclid, Boethius, and Ptolemy. The last subject category 
was humane literature or what we would call rhetoric, history, grammer, poetry, 
and moral philosophy. A specific example of subject headings from the library 
of dukes of Urbino in Italy include: Scriptures, Church Fathers, Medicien, Law,
Cosmography, History, Poets, Grammarians, and Orators with the more promeniate 
and privleged material belonging to religious topics and treatries. [#]_
