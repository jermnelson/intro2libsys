Sir Anthony Panizzi
-------------------
Sir Anthony Panizzi (1797-1879) was a naturalized British Italian who after immigrating
to England, started working for the British Muesum's library. Working his way through
the ranks, Panizzi eventually became the Principal Librarian and was knighted by
Queen Victoria in 1869. Panizzi is principly known for his `"Ninety-One Cataloging Rules"`_

The following are a couple of examples:

  2. Titles to be arranged alphabetically, according to the English alphabet only 
     (whatever be the order of the alphabet in which a foreign name might have to 
	 be entered in its original language) under the surname of the author, whenever it 
	 appears printed in the title, or in any other part of the book. If the name be 
	 supplied in manuscript, the work must nevertheless be considered anonymous, or 
	 pseudonymous, as the case may be, and the manuscript addition deemed merely a 
	 suggestion to which the librarian will attach such importance as he may think 
	 proper, on his own responsibility in supplying the author's name between brackets,
	 as hereafter directed.
	 
	 In the alphabetical arrangement initial prepositions letters or articles be 
	 taken in connection with the rest of the name 
	 
 16. Christian names, included in parentheses, to follow the surname, and all to be 
     written out in full, as far as they are known. In case of doubt, on this or 
	 any other point, when the librarian is directed to supply any information 
	 in cataloguing, a note of interrogation to follow in such a position as to indicate 
	 clearly the point on which any doubt is entertained.
	 
 53. Commentaries unaccompanied by the text, to be entered under the commentator's name;
     if without a name, or with an assumed name, then according to the rules laid down 
	 for anonymous or pseudonymous works.

These rules continue to influence the design of data standards and practices of librarians.
In rule fifty-three, we now have some guidence for determining and recording an author of
a comment on a blog post by a different author. As we look to build systems and integrate
with existing catalogs, we can start to codifiy such rules programattically and applied to
our records in a more automated fashion. 

In subsiquent chapters we will be examinging explict data structures and library systems
that reflect the legacy of Sir Anthony Panizzi business logic for the British Muesum technical 
services.

   The convenience of the public is always to be set before the ease of
   the cataloger...A plain rule without exceptions is not only easy for 
   us to carry out, but easyfor the public to understand and work by. [#]_

We would do well to remember this quote from Charles Cutter in 
his Rules for a Dictionary Catalog as we evaluation, think-about, and
work on library systems and resulting services.
