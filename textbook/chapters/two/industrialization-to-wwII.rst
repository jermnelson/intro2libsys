Sir Anthony Panizzi
-------------------
Sir Anthony Panizzi (1797-1879) was a naturalized British Italian who after immigrating
to England, started working for the British Museum's library. Working his way through
the ranks, Panizzi eventually became the Principal Librarian and was knighted by
Queen Victoria in 1869. Panizzi is principally known for his `"Ninety-One Cataloging Rules"`_

The following are a couple of examples:

 2. Titles to be arranged alphabetically, according to the English alphabet only 
    (whatever be the order of the alphabet in which a foreign name might have to 
    be entered in its original language) under the surname of the author, whenever it 
    appears printed in the title, or in any other part of the book. If the name be 
    supplied in manuscript, the work must nevertheless be considered anonymous, or 
    pseudonymous, as the case may be, and the manuscript addition deemed merely a 
    suggestion to which the librarian will attach such importance as he may think 
    proper, on his own responsibility in supplying the author's name between brackets,
    as hereafter directed.
	 
    In the alphabetical arrangement initial prepositions letters or articles be 
    taken in connection with the rest of the name 
	 
 16. Christian names, included in parentheses, to follow the surname, and all to be 
     written out in full, as far as they are known. In case of doubt, on this or 
     any other point, when the librarian is directed to supply any information 
     in cataloguing, a note of interrogation to follow in such a position as to indicate 
     clearly the point on which any doubt is entertained.
	 
 53. Commentaries unaccompanied by the text, to be entered under the commentator's name;
     if without a name, or with an assumed name, then according to the rules laid down 
     for anonymous or pseudonymous works.

These rules continue to influence the design of data standards and practices of librarians.
In rule fifty-three, we now have some guidance for determining and recording an author of
a comment on a blog post by a different author. As we look to build systems and integrate
with existing catalogs, we can start to codify such rules programmatically and applied to
our records in a more automated fashion. 

In subsequent chapters we will be examining explicit data structures and library systems
that reflect the legacy of Sir Anthony Panizzi business logic for the British Museum technical 
services.

Andrew Carnegie
---------------
Andrew Carnegie (1835-1919) was a nineteenth Scottish-American industrialist who made his fortune in the  
steel and railroad industries. After retiring, Carnegie spent the reminder of his life
pursing his philanthropic interests, including the building of public libraries across 
the United States and United Kingdom.
 
Melvil Dewey
------------
Melvil Dewey (1851-1931), he of the Dewey Decimal classification fame, was an American librarian and educator 
who's biggest contribution was the development of his classification scheme that is widely used
in public and academic libraries. He was one of the founders of the American Library Association
and one of the largest library companies of the time, the Library Bureau.  

Charles Cutter
--------------
Charles Cutter (1837-1903) was an American librarian and library education who lived in the latter half
of the nineteenth century and early part of the twentieth century.
 
   The convenience of the public is always to be set before the ease of
   the cataloger...A plain rule without exceptions is not only easy for 
   us to carry out, but easy for the public to understand and work by. [#]_

We would do well to remember this quote from Charles Cutter in 
his Rules for a Dictionary Catalog as we learn, evaluate, and think about
library systems, information technology, and ancillary supporting resource
and services. 

Sirkali Ramamrita Ranganathan
-----------------------------
S.R. Ranganathan (1892-1972) was Indian librarian and mathematician who made numerous 
contributions to the field of the library science including the five laws of library
science:

    1. Books are for use.
    2. Every reader his [or her] book.
    3. Every book its reader.
    4. Save the time of the reader.
    5. The library is a growing organism. [#]_

These laws influenced the design of not only the physical structure and layout 
of libraries but also the philosophy and service ethos of libraries.
