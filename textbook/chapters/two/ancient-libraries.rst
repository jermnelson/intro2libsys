Ancient Libraries
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Mesopotamia
-----------
The oldest known library, from around 1650 B.C.E, served a population size of 
250,000 in what is present-day Ebla, Syria. The are approximately 20,000 clay 
tablets written in a cuneiform dialect and were organized into such subjects
as taxes and other business records including food and drink inventories. [#]_

A couple of details from the excavation of Ebla show some insight in how 
these collections were organized. Subject classification seems to be the
first organizational category used by in the Ebla library. [#]_ Explicit titles
are not mentioned or if titles were assigned, the title itself was not
inscribed in stone tablets. Authorship attribution as a organizational 
tool was also absent in Ebla. 

Another famous Mesopotamia library was Assyrian King Assurbanipal's library
in what is current day Iraq. King Ashurbanipal Library, the clay tablet's
subject determined it's shape. Financial transactions were four-sided and 
agricultural subjects were round. [#]_ King Assurbanipal's Library provides another
trend in libraries, that of patron being associated closely with the collecting
and organizational structure of the various collections. 

Greek & Roman
-------------
Libraries were important to first the ancient Greeks later followed by the Romans
and the Roman empire. These libraries were primarily composed of rolls of parchment or
velum (calf's leather) and were usually organized by subject. 


Egypt & the Alexandria Library
------------------------------
While much speculation exists regarding early Egyptian libraries in the time 
Pharaohs (i.e. they existed but were likely reserved for religious purposes), when
Egypt was later conquered by Alexander the Great and then the Roman Empire, the 
most famous library ever was started in Alexandria and continued to grow in collection
size and prestige through-out the classical period in history. This `clip`_
from Carl Sagan's show "Cosmos" offers a more elioquent view on the Alexandra Library:

What about..??
--------------
Libraries certainly existed in ancient China and Japan although within their different
literacy traditions; the collecting, borrowing, and lending practices wasn't as
prominent or well-developed as in the West. Likewise, while Aztec
and other Mesoamerican societies had libraries, they tended to focus on religious
topics. In one of the great tragedies of history, the Spanish colonization efforts
at attempting to eradicate the native culture, language, and customs, included
destroying all copies of any of these Aztec codices.
