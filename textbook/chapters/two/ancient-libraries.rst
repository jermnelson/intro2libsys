Mesopotamia
-----------
The oldest known library, from around 1650 B.C.E, served a population size of 
250,000 in what is present-day Ebla, Syria. The are approximately 20,000 clay 
tablets written in a cuneiform dialect and were organized into such subjects
as taxes and other business records including food and drink inventories. [#]_

A couple of details from the excavation of Ebla show some insight in how 
these collections were organized. Subject classification seems to be the
first organizational category used by in the Ebla library. [#]_ Explicit titles
are not mentioned or if titles were assigned, the title itself was not
inscribed in stone tablets. Authorship attribution as a organizational 
tool was also absent in Ebla. 

Another famous Mesopotamia library was Assyrian King Assurbanipal's library
in what is current day Iraq. King Assurbanipal Library, the clay tablet's
subject determined it's shape. Financial transactions were four-sided and 
agricultural subjects were round. [#]_ King Assurbanipal's Library provides another
trend in libraries, that of patron being associated closely with the collecting
and organizational structure of the various collections.
