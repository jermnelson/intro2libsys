World War II's massive destruction of buildings in Europe and Asia, which not 
surprisingly included a larger number of libraries in those regions including 
an estimated 1/2 of all books in China [#]_ . Recovering ... 

In the immediate aftermath until well into the 1960s, numerous countries 
went on a library building spree, either rebuilding damaged or destroyed
libraries and construction of new libraries, both public and academic 
libraries to support new colleges and universities being founded especially
in Asia. 

Vannevar Bush
-------------
Vannevar Bush was an American engineer who work included analog computers
and during World War II coordinate most scientific research for the American
war effort including a critical oversight of the Manhattan project that 
produced the first atomic weapons. In 1945, Bush published a very influential
essay, `As We May Think`_ that described a new type of information
organization with what we would think of as hyperlinks in a large corpus of
text. This essay was very influential for early computer scientists, including
Douglas Engelbart the inventor of the mouse and hypertext [#]_ , as they 
developed the first digital computers in the later half of the 20th century.

Even at this early stage in the development of the modern personal computer, 
the challenges to the library and its supporting technologies becomes evident
as Bush and Englebart, amoung others, was already looking at a different model
of information organization that was different from the conceptual models and
technologies used in the libraries at the time. Clearly they were influenced by 
how knowledge was organized at their time but they also offer still relevant 
insights in how humans interact with informaiton as not as a passive actor but
an active and engaged intellences seeking, responding, and creating information.
