===================================
The Continued Distruption of Google 
===================================
More than any other company, `Google`_'s search service looms over the
design and expectations users have for their library systems, including
catalogs and scholarly databases. At first, the reactions of librarians and technology 
vendors was to dismiss Google while using Google themselves for their own research. 

As users become accustomed to the quirks and results of Google's user interface, some publishers
of electronic resources are modifying their own search interfaces to mimic Google. Other
publishers and library system vendors are taking other approaches by trying to differeiate 
their own user interfaces and algorithms which provides other challenges, especially those
librarians and teachers instructing students on information literacy for high school and
undergraduate education. [#]_ 

What lessons can we take from Google?
-------------------------------------
Google's resources along with their billions of dollars spent on research and development
of information services, will continue to challenge the library profession, especially 
library systems.

Simplicity 
^^^^^^^^^^
For the first few years of Google's search service, their main page was a single, simple
search box along with a Google's logo and a few links at the bottom of the page. Only in 
the past few years has Google expanded to include a top bar with links to their other
services including Gmail, Photos, Calendar, Reader, and Google+. A design challenge for
library systems is to not just keep adding resources and services to systems that library
has direct control over, but to start simple and only add more content if the user interface
testing and requirements absolutely dictate it. 

Privacy & Data Retention
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
While Google and other corporations are tracking and retaining large amounts of data about
their users, this trend is often at odds with librarian's and the values of the profession.
While their is a counter-trend among some [NEED REFERENCE] librarian and other in the
profession, following the old adage, *if you can't beat 'um join 'um*, to lose this 
important value would jeopardize a long-standing expectation library patrons have about 
their libraries and by extension, library systems. 

This is a gray area and while there are strong counter-arguments and utility to tracking
users as they again, have become accustomed to the level of service that Google provides, 
libraries and library systems may need to adjust and evolve if we are to remain relevant 
and useful for our patrons needs. One compromise is to be as transparent as possible about
the nature and type of data that the library systems collect on patrons and to allow the patron
to explicitly opt-in to any data collecting being done by library systems. This may be harder
if libraries become too dependent on library system vendors driven by profit maximization for
shareholders or owners that do not necessarily align with the the core values of privacy 
advocated by libraries.   

It is a cop-out and intellectually disingious to fall back on the arguments that younger
patrons have different privacy expectations than older patrons and because of that difference
then, it is permissible to collect as much personally identifiable information as possible
on the library patrons. As stewards of the culture's intellectual and popular artifacts, 
libraries should take a longer term view and consider the implications of keeping and 
maintaining too much data about the library's patrons. Libraries are usually not driven by
quarterly performance that is obsession of corporate information services like Google, 
Facebook, and Twitter. While it might be inevitable that most interactions are tracked in 
highly specific and granual methods, libraries have an obligation to their patrons to at 
least educate and offer options to the patrons outside of a strictly commercial realm or 
role.
