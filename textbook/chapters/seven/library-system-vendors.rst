Library System Vendors
======================
In chapter 4, we examined the major ILS and library services platform
vendors and their specific products so we won't go into each vendor's 
specific product lines and services. Instead, we will take a broader
view and examine the broader landscape of the library systems industry, 
including niche companies that offer very specific services or technology
to libraries.
