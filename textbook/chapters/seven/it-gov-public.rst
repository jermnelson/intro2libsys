Information Technology in Government & Public Libraries
=======================================================
It might seem to be self-evident, that library systems interpreter
with other organizations and technology. Most libraries; public, academic, or
special, belong to one or more consortia or groups of libraries that share
resources, expertise, and costs as one method of maintaining or even expanding
resource availability and services. Publishers, broadly defined as those
corporations and organizations that sell or provide intellectual resources,
are another external entities that library systems must interact with and
provide access to those resources. Library vendors are the third external
entities that librarians must deal with, often spending many hours troubleshooting
or managing the vendor's technology to meet the needs of the library's
patron.
