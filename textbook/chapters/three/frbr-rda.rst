Functional Requirements Bibliographic Records (FRBR)
----------------------------------------------------
FRBR is an entity-relationship model where entities are the objects of interest
that are defined in a most general way as possible along with the relationships 
between entities. Each entity is defined with a set of attributes or 
characteristics and the relationships or associations with other entities. 

FRBR defines three groups of entities.

First Group FRBR Entities
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
First Group is made up of the intellectual or artistic products and these 
entities are work, expression, manifestation, and items. These four 
entities are often referred to WEMI.

Second Group FRBR Entities
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Second Group is made up the entities responsible for the creation, production, 
publication, dissemination, or custodianship of the first group of entities. 
FRBR identifies these as either person or corporate body entities.

Third Group FRBR Entities
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Third Group are entities that serve as subjects for the WEMI entities and are 
concept, object, event and place.

Resource Description and Access (RDA)
-------------------------------------
RDA is a newer framework for bibliographic cataloging that includes guidelines 
and instructions for describing artifacts and relationships of those artifacts 
with entities like a person, organizations, and concepts. RDA is based on the
FRBR and FRAD (Functional Requirements for Authority Data) specifications as well 
as incorporating various elements from AACR2.

RDA is meant to support end user resource discovery in library systems in 
finding a resource, identifying a specific resource among similar resources, 
selecting a resource, and finally obtaining the resource. Likewise, for 
entities associated with resources, RDA should assist end users in finding 
information on the entity or resources associated with the entity, identifying
the entity from among similar entities, clarifying the relationship between the 
entity and other entities, and understanding why an entity has a certain name, 
title, or form.
