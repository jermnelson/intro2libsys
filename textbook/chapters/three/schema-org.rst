In 2011, Google, Microsoft, and Yahoo started a initative to provide a common 
set of HTML tags and attributes, called schemas, that allows websites to 
semantically describe common objects like websites, books, music, and media
for harvesting by these search engines. In November of 2011 Yandex, the largest
search engine in Russia, joined the initative. These schema are available at 
`schema.org`_
