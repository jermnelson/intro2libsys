What does Linked Data mean? The FAQ at `Linkeddata.org`_ defines Linked Data as::

  The term Linked Data refers to a set of best practices for publishing and 
  connecting structured data on the Web. Key technologies that support Linked 
  Data are URIs (a generic means to identify entities or concepts in the world), 
  HTTP (a simple yet universal mechanism for retrieving resources, or 
  descriptions of resources), and RDF (a generic graph-based data model with 
  which to structure and link data that describes things in the world). [#]_

The W3C provides a listing of various `data sets`_ as linked data. These 
data sets cover a wide range of different domains, including data sets from 
the United States and British Governments, CIA Factbook, medical drugs, 
Craigslist, and various geographical datasets. One of the largest data sets,
`DBpedia`_, offers the entire `Wikipedia`_ website as linked data.

British Library Linked Data
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The national library of the United Kingdom, the `British Library`_, is offering
their bibliographic holdings as linked data. To access their holdings as linked
data, the British Library offers a number of web services that right now only 
covers their monographs published since 1950 although they are planning to offer
linked data access to their serials and other formats in the near future. 

Library of Congress's Bibliographic Framework
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
In October 2012, the Library of Congress announced a 
`Bibliographic Framework Transition Initiative`_ for eventually a replacement
for MARC. In February the Library of Congress hired a consulting firm to create
a prototype that meets the requirements for the Bibliographic Framework using
linked data.

SPARQL and RDF
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
`SPARQL`_ is a protocol for searching RDF and other triple stores.
