An important component of the **Introduction to Library Systems** is a group
project with a library-based topic. The first class session you will get a 
chance to meet with your fellow classmates and you should start thinking about
what two or three other students you would like to join for group project.

The goal of the project exercise is to give you hands-on experience in AGILE
software development practices while learning about typical development and 
administration tasks as you and your group roll-out at library system for 
a collection by an external organization. Many of you work or are involved with 
different types of organizations that may have a small collection of 
lending materials that would be a good candidate for a lightweight catalog. After
you decide the members of your group, you will need to decide what external 
organization your group will approach. If your group doesn't have organization to 
assist, the course instructor has a couple of opportunities for group projects 
with local libraries.
