Git Distributed Version Control System
======================================
All class code and response questions will be managed through the 
distributed version control system called `Git`_. `Git`_ is open source 
and is available on most operating systems. Many open-source projects use
Git to manage their source code for their project; including many of library
open source projects. 

Introduction to Distributed Version Control System (DVCS)
---------------------------------------------------------
Version control is just the ability to keep track of the edit history of
a file. Centralized version control systems like `Subversion`_ (`SVN`_)
and Micosoft's `Visual SourceSafe`_ require a master repository hosted on a dedicated
server.
