This eBook started off as a website for a class I'm teaching at University
of Denver's Library Graduate School of the same title in the fall of 2012.
As I continued to develop the course's website, I felt the content would
be better structured as a more traditional textbook. 

The conceit I started with was that by using the Sphinx documentation
framework, I could write the core content for the textbook and share that
same content to the Django-based framework that I was turning more into
rough beginnings of a distributed learning system (DLS) that would
complement a more traditional textbook. 

My intention that this textbook and accompanying DLS will provide a 
useful start for individuals interested in pursuing a librarian career
in technology or technical services although any information professional
should benefit from a better understanding of the library systems they
depend on assisting patrons or in their daily work-flow.
