==============
Course Project
==============
By the beginning of the third week, students will be expected to form into
small groups of two to three people. Each group will be expected to design,
code, and present an example of a library system using the technologies from
this course including `Django`_, `Aristotle Library App`_, and `Redis`_.

You will use `Git`_ to coordinate and track each group member's contribution. 

Requirements
------------
The basic outline of the course project requirements are:

1. Catalog, develop, and host an Aristotle Library App portfolio
   for cataloged collection of a small non-profit, corporate,
   public or academic library, or some other type of organization. 
   Many organizations have collections of
   subject-specific materials that are managed and described in a very
   ad-hoc manner. 
	
2. You will systemically catalog and offer a web or mobile 
   interface to the collection.

	
Example Project
---------------
To give you an idea on how to proceed in, each chapter will have group project
exercises to assist you in applying the skills and knowledge that you are learning
in this course. In each chapter's project exercises, we track the progress of building
a library system for a small collection of DVD and Periodicals used by an Aikido dojo 
in Colorado Springs, `Pikes Peak Aikido`_.
