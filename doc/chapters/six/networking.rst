As libraries continue to shift from just being repositories for physical
medium to more electronic-based materials coupled with growing expectations
by all users that web and data access is always there and available, means
that networking infrastructure and support is critical for the library
systems. This trend is espcially true for academic and special libraries as more 
scholarly and grey literature are born digitial and may never be in print
and much of the library's existing and new services are heavily dependent
on having a high-speed network connection to the Internet. 

Depending on the size of the library or organization, library 
systems unit or librarians may be fully responsible for the entire 
network stack of routers, wiring, servers, and telecom connectivity to the
internal network. Beside maintaining the network connection to the external
world, the library systems group may also be responsible for maintaining
the local internal networks. or LANs (Local Area Networks) connecting 
library staff and patron computers to each other, internal servers, and 
to peripherals like printers, scanners, and barcode readers. 

Wireless
--------
One of the most popular services library's offer is either restricted
or unrestricted wireless access to patrons and staff. While there exists
other wireless technologies, the most likely wireless technology that a 
library systems may support are usually those that are based on the IEEE
802.11 set of standards.
