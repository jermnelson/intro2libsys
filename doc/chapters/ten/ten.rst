Library Systems in the Future
=============================
The future of library systems is closely linked with broader future of 
libraries in general. In 2010 the Assocition of College and
Research Libraries (ACRL), a division of the American Library Association,
released a report `Futures Thinking for Academic Librarians: Higher 
Education in 2025`_ by  Staley and Malenfant. In this report, the authors
created 26 different types of scenarios with different likelihood of 
happening within the 15 years time horizon of the report. Some of these
scenarios are specific to the academic library and higher education but
others apply equally to public education. 

There seems to be no dearth of individuals both inside and outside of the 
library profession making predictions, some encouraging and hopeful [#]_, 
others pesstimatic [#]_, negative [#]_, or downright hostile [#]_ about the future
libraries and librarians.

   Be aware that different scenarios of your classmates may be place in 
   a different catagory than you do. For example, a strong Open Access or
   Open source advocate better future might be the same future that is worse for a 
   vendor or publisher. 

James Casico, a noted futurist, offers a `framework`_ for scenario planning when he works for
corporations and other organizations. First, create four scenarios around these four 
different assumpsitions. We will do the same thing under the overall theme of
**Library Systems in the Future** within in the next five years:
