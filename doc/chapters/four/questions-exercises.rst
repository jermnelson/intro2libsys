Chapter Four Questions and Exercises
====================================

Questions
---------
1. How was the addition of subject-title-author card catalogs an improvement over the
   ad hoc organizing technology that preceeded it?
   
2. What problems identified by [NEED CITATION] in the 1980s electronic catalogs are 
   still relevant after three decades? Do you think library systems have made progress
   since then?

Exercises
---------

1. Library Survey
   Pick an available public and an academic library in the United States. Contact
   the instructor with your choices. You may need to pick again if another student 
   already has selected that library (selection is first-come-first-serve). 

   Find out what ILS they are currently using, the population they serve, and approximate
   budget for technology.

2. Download and run Open Source ILS

   Download and attempt to install any of these open-source ILS systems; `Koha`_,
   `Evergreen`_, or `NewGenLib`_.
