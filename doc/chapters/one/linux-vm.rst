Linux Virtual Server
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
You will be expected to run your course assignments and projects on a 
Linux Virtual Server. The latest Ubuntu Server release is used for 
development and demonstration of class projects; however, if you are more
comfortable using another Linux distribution, please use what you are
most comfortable with using. 

This course has an available VM on Rackspace and Amazon Web Services 
for those students who wish to use those commercial clouse service providers. 

The same class Ubuntu Virtual Machine image can also be downloaded and
used in other cloud providers including Microsoft's Azuze cloud services 
(a note of irony for those of us who remember Steve Ballmer saying that
Linux was a cancer, maybe he was right!)::

  **Steve Ballmer once described Linux as a "cancer", but in recent months 
  we've heard that Microsoft is running its Skype division off Linux boxes, 
  and it's now offering a Linux-based version of its Azure cloud service - 
  does this give you satisfaction?**

  Well, let's say that I'm relieved that Microsoft seems to have at least 
  to some degree stopped seeing Linux as the enemy. The whole "cancer" 
  and "un-American" thing was really pretty embarrassing.

Your Linux VM should be publically available on a registered
a domain name of your choosing. Learning how to manage a cloud-based Linux server
provides you with experience of managing live and active servers on the same
architecture you'll be using as a librarian or employee in a typical small
to mid-range information technology group in libraries.
