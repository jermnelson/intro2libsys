Python, Django, & reStructured Text
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ 
All course code will be taught using the `Python`_ programming language.
Along with `Python`_, we will use the `Python`_-based web framework called
`Django`_ for any front-end web development needs including project and
assignments. If `Python`_ is new, a listing of tutorials and other resources
for learning `Python`_ are available at `<http://wiki.python.org/moin/BeginnersGuide>`_.

The open-source blended learning environment, including this course's 
creative commons licensed text-book, is all written using a mark-up style
called `reStructuredText`_  the most common format of its type in the 
`Python`_ community. All assignments and project documentation, including
your source code documentation, should be done in, or converted to, 
reStructuredText. You will manage your `reStructuredText`_ files with 
`Git`_.
