Publishers

Very much like libraries, the publishing industry is going through major
changes as it responds and evolves in shifting from physical mediums to
the born digital world where distribution and copying costs are negibility 
but the content creation is still expensive.

   In early 2012 a group of academics, frustrated and upset by continued
   price increase of Elsevier journals, along with Elsevier's lobbying
   support the Research Works Act that would have rolled back open access
   and open data requirements, started a boycott[#]_ that rapidly made 
   headlines in the non-academic press. In Academic publishing, unlike
   other publishing venues, writing, editing, and managing the scholarly 
   workflow is mostly done free-of-charge to the publisher by academics.
   Individuals pledged not publish, referee, or do any editorial work for
   Elsevier 
   
   A group of more radical academics suggested that libraries, in 
   particular academic libraries, take on more of a scholarly publishing
   role which differs from the library's traditional role of collecting
   and disemenating materials.
   
   What challenges and opportunties for libraries would assuming this new
   role involve?
