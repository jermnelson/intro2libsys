Consortiums
===========
A library's level of participation and costs vary with the types of shared 
services and resources offered by any one consortium. Some consortiums
just offer discounts on databases or journal packages due to the better negoation 
positions a larger group has verses the reduced clout of an individual library.
Other consortiums offer staff training and professional development opportunities
for their member libraries in addition to other services like inter-library loan,
shared union catalog that allows patrons to search across each library's catalog in
a single interface. Some consortiums offer a centrally hosted ILS, link resolvers,
and digital repositiores for their member libraries so that each member library 
does not have to maintain their own systems group. Also, depending on the cost
and the type of consortium, many libraries are members of multiple consortiums in 
order to leverage the strengths of each consortium to meet the needs of the 
library.
