Information Technology in Start-ups & Small Libraries
=====================================================
While software start-ups and small libraries are not often linked,
successful, both types of organizations are usually human and capital
restrained, although usually with different cash flow streams and
organization termination (small libraries that service critical needs to 
their communities, may have funding cut or other reduced cash inflow; while
an unsuccessful start-up usually goes bankrupt or is purchased by other
corporation. 

Successful entrepenears utilitize every available technology and human
resource to deliever a product or service to their intended customers. 
Successful smaller libraries, with their focus on service by 
meeting the informational and entertainment needs of their patrons, become
local informational experts assisting patrons while also being mindful of 
their duty as cultural stewards of the local cultural that may include 
a dedicated special collections (more common in smaller academic libraries)
or at least providing access to ad hoc archieves, including local paper 
microfilm and phone books, in the case of small public library.   

Cloud Computing
---------------
We have already discussed specific cloud computing technology so we won't
go into the specific technologies here but instead consider how cloud computing
is used by start-ups and how their approaches can be applied to the small 
library.

Instead of needing to buy hardware and worry about all of the networking,
physical management, and dedicated system administrators that go along with
physical servers, by utilitizing various cloud offerings, a lean organization
can develop or deploy enterprise-level software and services without the
extra costs and expertise involved with managing physical servers. 

Collaboration
-------------
While start-ups tend to not collaborate with their peers (although many start-ups are active contributors and inventors of open-source software so in they do
collaborate on shared codebases, primarily open-source projets), small libraries
should collaborate with similar or nearby libraries or other cultural 
organizations like museums and historical societies.  

Regional & National Consortiums
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
In Colorado, many smaller rural libraries are members of consortiums such as
`Marmot`_ on the Western Slope, that allow them to use a centrally hosted
ILS that is shared among similar libraries. Other libraries participate in
`Prospector`_, a union catalog hosted and managed by the Colorado Alliance of
Research Libraries.

More regional consortiums, such as Lyarsis or Amigos, also offer opportunities
to share or purchase additional resources and services, sharing the costs and
mitigating risk to a larger group. Coordinating group purchasing of resources
can be more challenging to a smaller library's administration to coordinate
resource sharing on ad hoc basis compared to participating in these larger
consoritums.

At the highest level are national and international organizations like OCLC,
that can be leveraged by smaller libraries. Library systems vendors are also
interested in providing hosted ILS services but that can be challenging to 
support in resource constrained environments of small libraries or start-ups
that are in the library systems industry. 

Local Libraries, Museums, and Cultural Organizations
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^  
Particularly in rural areas that may also have a community or regional college
or university, public libraries often collaborate with the local academic 
library in their community. Smaller libraries may also collaborate with other
similar smaller libraries in communities that are relatively nearby with 
relatively wide range of informal and formal collaborative agreements. 

Local Museums and Cultural organizations, such as historical societies, or even
state and federal departmental libraries and offices may also share resources
and expertise. A fruitful exploration of these other organzations can result
increase of resources or offer opportunities for shared services, especially 
with the advent of cloud computing resources that make it marginally more 
expensive to add capacity to meet multiple organizational needs.
