Intro2LibSys Operations README
==============================
This is the `Intro2LibSys`_ virtual server operations directory where the 
`Introduction to Library Systems`_ textbook built with `Sphinx`_ and 
the Distributed Learning System built with `Django`_ and `Redis`_ to support
this textbook.

Distributed Learning System
---------------------------
The `Intro2LibSys`_ main site is built with `Django`_ with `SQLite`_ and
`Redis`_ for relational database and distributed datastore usage. 

Text Book
---------
`Intro2LibSys`_ is organized and built around a `Sphinx`_ project that uses
reStructured text for core content along with the same version of Twitter's
Bootstrap used in the DSL. The textbook is also available as a PDF and ePub
downloads. 

Example Project
--------------- 
An important component of `Intro2LibSys`_ is for students to work on a
course project built using the `Aristotle Library Apps`_ framework. Each
instruction session has related project exercises using an example library
catalog built for a non-profit Aikido Dojo with the code repository available
at `https://github.com/jermnelson/ppacatalog <https://github.com/jermnelson/ppacatalog>`_.
